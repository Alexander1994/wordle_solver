# wordle_solver

A simple worlde solver with an average of 4.5 against the entire wordle dictionary (The game itself uses a subset of popular words, which is why on average humans do better)
The solver reduces search space by selecting a guess based on the sum of each letter's popularity and it's popularity at that space. This is not optimal but was a fun challenge prior to optimal solutions being discovered.
